# How to implement a custom report service providing report documents/layouts


<p>This example illustrates how to create a custom WCF-based report service that provides report documents/layouts to its clients. Note that the <strong>HostApp.</strong><strong>IReport</strong><strong>Service</strong> interface in this example is not related to the built-in <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsServiceIReportServicetopic"><u>DevExpress.XtraReports.Service.IReportService</u></a> interface which is targeted to <strong>WPF/Silverlight</strong> applications whereas the <strong>HostApp.IReportService</strong> interface is targeted to <strong>WinFo</strong><strong>rms/ASP.NET</strong> applications. Here is its definition:</p>

```cs
    [ServiceContract]
    public interface IReportService {
        [OperationContract]
        string[] GetReportNames();
        [OperationContract]
        byte[] GetReportLayout(string reportName);
        [OperationContract]
        byte[] GetReportDocument(string reportName);        
        [OperationContract]
        byte[] GetParametrizedReportDocument(string reportName, ReportParameterInfo[] parameters);
    }
    
    [DataContract]
    public class ReportParameterInfo {
        [DataMember]
        public string Name { get; set; }
        [DataMember]
        public object Value { get; set; }
    }
```

<p> </p><p>As you see, it allows you to obtain the report data in the following forms:</p><p>1) Layout (REPX in this example). <br />
2) Document (PRNX in this example). In this scenario you can also use the GetParametrizedReportDocument() method if the report constructed in the WCF service context should be supplied with non-default parameters.</p><p>The <strong>HostApp </strong>project contains the WFC service contract and implementation. It is a console-based self-hosted WCF service which exposes two endpoints with <strong>http </strong>and <strong>net.tcp</strong><strong> </strong>transports correspondingly. <br />
The client application is contained in the <strong>ClientApp </strong>project. We have added a service reference to it by using the approach from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb628652.aspx"><u>How to: Add, Update, or Remove a Service Reference</u></a> MSDN article.</p><p>Take a special note of the <strong>maxReceivedMessageSize </strong>attribute defined in the <strong>app.config</strong> files of the client and host applications.</p><p>Finally, it is necessary to specify a correct startup order of the projects in the solution property pages (the host application should be started first):</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-implement-a-custom-report-service-providing-report-documents-layouts-e4445/12.1.9+/media/9f30a55c-ddb5-4336-b18f-626d852d7e9c.png"></p><p><strong>See Also:</strong><br />
